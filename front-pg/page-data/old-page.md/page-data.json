The motivation for the Operate First\ninitiative is the shift of focus from software availability to operating services. Open Source removed\nthe access to software as a limiting factor for businesses and individuals. However, with software\nproliferating into every aspect of the business - and our world in general - resulting in ever growing\ncomplexity of software stacks, the challenge is now operationalizing software.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-operate-first\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-operate-first\" aria-label=\"why operate first permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why Operate First?</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The ability to have hands on the MOC environment while installing two open source project releases was of real value. Our teams were able to resolve critical interdependencies that the test suites had not found. I could not imagine trying to work with a customer to debug this problem.\"</p> <small><cite>- An operate first member</cite></small>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Operate First is inspired by Red Hat’s <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/what-open-source-upstream\">“Upstream First” philosophy</a>, which emphasizes <strong>working in the open</strong>, even for Red Hat products. Operate First tries to extend “working in the open” to a part of the codebase that teams typically keep closed, even when deploying open source projects: their operations code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"key-personas\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#key-personas\" aria-label=\"key personas permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Key Personas</h2>\n<div class=\"pf-l-flex pf-m-align-items-stretch pf-m-justify-content-center pf-m-wrap\">\n<div class=\"pf-c-card pf-m-flat ofc-gallery-card\">\n    <div class=\"pf-c-card__body\">\n      <img src=\"https://cdn2.vectorstock.com/i/thumbs/20/76/man-avatar-profile-vector-21372076.jpg\" alt=\"Developer/QE\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"pf-c-card__title\">\n      <h3>Developer/QE</h3>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"pf-c-card__body\">\n      <p>To start streamlining your development workflows, e.g. CI/CD, join the Operate First effort at the OI Labs community.</p>\n      <small><a href=\"/users/support/docs/intro.md\" target=\"_blank\">OpenInfra Labs Community</a></small>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"pf-c-card pf-m-flat ofc-gallery-card\">\n    <div class=\"pf-c-card__body\">\n      <img src=\"https://cdn2.vectorstock.com/i/thumbs/20/76/man-avatar-profile-vector-21372076.jpg\" alt=\"Cloud Operator/SRE &amp; Sys Admin\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"pf-c-card__title\">\n      <h3>Cloud Operator/SRE &amp; Sys Admin</h3>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"pf-c-card__body\">\n      <p>To improve observability and monitoring capabilities, join the telemetry working group.</p>\n      <small><a href=\"https://openinfralabs.org/telemetry/\" target=\"_blank\">Telemetry Working Group</a></small>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-operate-first\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#benefits-of-operate-first\" aria-label=\"benefits of operate first permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Benefits of Operate First</h2>\n<div class=\"pf-l-flex pf-m-align-items-stretch pf-m-justify-content-center pf-m-wrap\">\n  <div class=\"pf-c-card pf-m-flat ofc-gallery-card\">\n    <div class=\"pf-c-card__title\">\n      <h3>Operationalize Software</h3>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"pf-c-card__body\">\n      <p>Making software available is not sufficient unless we are also making available the\n        capability to operate the software in production.
